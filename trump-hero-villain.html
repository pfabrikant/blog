            <h2>Trump a hero and a villain</h2>
            <p class="tldr"><strong>TL;DR</strong> Trump is both the best thing that happened to the liberal west in the last decades and at the same time one of the biggest threats to liberalism and democracy. I suggest to practice holding space for this self-contradictory view, as inconvenient as it may be. Though it is clearly easier to avoid the inherent tension of this position by adhering to one of the political monoculture movements instead, I believe that resolving the cognitive and moral tension of this position is a conscious choice of rigidity and of expanding our blind spots, thus making us part of the problem.</p>
            
            <p>The Iranian people are bleeding. The deadliest protests in Iran's modern history since the Islamic revolution have erupted a few weeks ago and have lately turned into a horrible bloodbath. Thousands of protestors were murdered last week by the regime's forces, many deliberately shot in the head, while tens of thousands were arrested and are awaiting an unknown future. The first executions of demonstrators are planned. The internet has been cut off. The few accounts that emerged out of the darkness all describe scenes of horror and unfathomable brutality. Many of the accounts convey a simple message - we are afraid, we are alone, please help us.</p>
            
            <p>And in response? The usual measured diplomatic formulations by heads of state. Most of them - empty statements, at best containing vague and weak threats. All but Donald Trump's. He was the first major politician to voice support for the protests and issue concrete threats against the Iranian regime. The only leader who used clear language and referred to concrete consequences.</p>
            
            <p>In the last weeks, I was repeatedly filled with gratitude for Donald Trump. A Similar emotion to what I felt half a year ago following his intervention in the ongoing war in Gaza. When everyone else stuck with their cliche declarations and expressions of concerns, Donald Trump aggressively pushed a deal to end the active phase of the war. Was it a good deal? Would it result in regional stabilization and a sustainable solution? Hard to say, but this are secondary questions when considering what was at stake at that moment - two years into an endless war: blood flowing in the streets and people starving. He didn't manage to stop it completely, but he reduced the suffering considerably. Not the liberal Biden nor the progressive EU leaders managed to slow down the racist war crimes of the Israeli government, it was done by the right populist anti-democratic Trump.</p>
            
            <p>Does that mean that I like Trump, or that I believe that some of his effective interventions in international conflicts completely offsets a growing number of what I see as extremely damaging policies introduced by his administration in his second term? No, I refuse to pick up a side. I deliberately sustain this state of tension between how thrilled I am to see his arrogant and forceful approach succeed in partially restraining some of the worst regimes on this planet and between how horrified I am to see his executive orders tearing immigrant families apart, sowing terror in the hearts of way too many Americans without citizenship. How can you love and hate, adore and be repulsed by a leader and his ideology practically at the same time? This, I believe, is the secret that could potentially free us of the growing gridlock we've been seeing in western politics in the last decade. I do not want to identify with a person or a view, a political movement or an ideology to the point that it suddenly makes me flag some of the emotions or opinions that I might harbor as wrong, offensive, shameful or stupid. I want to be free to cherry-pick, to be true to myself and the patchwork of ideas and believes I currently hold true, even if they are contradictory on some level. Mostly, I believe, that they are contradictory or incoherent from the point of view of the current political clans. How can I support gender equality and yet oppose political correctness? How can I criticize the US for its long history of imperialism in latin America and yet pray that it sends soldiers into Iran to bring the Ayatollah regime down? Well, that's what I feel and believe, and by admitting that it oftentimes does not neatly fit into a political or ideological monoculture, I guarantee myself a certain flexibility. I do not have to buy into an all inclusive package. MAGA or the progressive left. A zionist or a pro-palestinian. An anti-imperialist or a neo-liberal capitalist.</p>
            
            <p>In the last week, in response to Trump's threats, a good number of left leaning Politicians hurried to demonstrate how Trump's rhetoric and threats are a continuation of a rich tradition of American imperialism and interventionism. And just like that, the pleads of the Iranian people, who stand trembling in fear in front of the brutal forces of one of the most oppressive regimes on this planet, got silenced up by ideology. What so many Iranian protestors beg Trump to do is irrelevant, because Trump's real motivation comes down to oil and power. How neatly it all fits into their political narrative, how very satisfying it all is, if only these Iranian wouldn't ruin this ideological cleanliness! They are but just pawns. Oh forgive them for they know not what they are demonstrating about.</p>
            
            <p>Is Trump acting out of Altruism and a deep regard for human life? Quite improbable. Would the US, if it intervenes in this uprising, end up benefiting and cutting its share of Persian oil? Most likely. Does that mean that Trump should join the other inept western leaders and watch from aside while the Ayatollah regime butchers its own people? I believe not. What Trump did in Venezuella, in Gaza, in the Ukraine, in Nigeria and in Iran should not be all bundled together, flattened, normalized, standardized to fit the comfortable boxes of whatever party or ideology one identifies with. Each one of these interventions has a completely different context, the local populations reacted differently to it, the US interests are diverse in each case. Some should be condemned while some celebrated, and most of them probably deserve a complex and layered assessment. The kind that doesn't fit into a twit.</p>
            
            <p>But a careful consideration of a complex situation is not necessarily better than impulsiveness. It depends tremendously on the concrete circumstances. And in the case of the current protests in Iran, I see Trump's blunt and strong reaction as the most moral and humane way to react to the situation. Listening to these brave women and man, risking their lives to fight for freedom, begging for support, I couldn't care less for historical-ideological narratives. In my eyes, there is only one way to act, fast and firmly, and I am thankful that Trump's separatism and America First ideology is as flexible and inconsistent as my own political identity.</p>
