            <h2>My Smiling Depression</h2>
            <p>At the age of 43, after years of half-knowingly living with high-functioning depression, I've decided to start psychoanalysis. Three times a week, lying down on a sofa, deliberately diving into the dark depths I was avoiding for most of my life.</p>
            
            <p>I would like to share some of my thoughts and feelings toward my "high-functioning depression", also nicknamed "smiling depression" or in its clinical name: Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD). In recent years there has been a lot of open discussions surrounding mental health. An increasing number of people shared stories of their struggle with anxiety, especially following the covid pandemic and recent geo-political developments. Others are brave enough to have written about their major depression disorder (MDD) - the debilitating illness that prevented them from leading a fulfilling life, instead rendering them passive spectators of a life on hold. Reading these stories and testimonials, I felt relieved to learn that I was not the only one struggling. At the same time, I could never fully identify with these accounts of anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, I never stumbled upon a mention of the weird sibling of these conditions - the smiling depression. I have a feeling that there's a reason for that. It has to do with the adjective "highly-functional".</p>
            
            <p>People sharing their mental health struggles tended to emphasize the unmistakable and explicit manifestations of these conditions in their everyday life, symptoms that prevented them from doing the things that would actually be beneficial for them (loving, resting, socializing, traveling, working-out, etc). This was almost always where I lost the thread - again and again realizing this wasn't similar to what I am struggling with after all.</p>
            
            <p>They were obviously struggling and in pain, while I wasn't sure I was. They had real symptoms, I had none. They were courageously fighting debilitating illnesses, I was a pathetic wanna-be victim complaining about made-up first world problems. Reading accounts of anxiety and depression always followed the same pattern - I was first excited to read about feelings I secretly harbored for such a long time only to be later disillusioned to find out that these feelings had to be rooted in what really matters - objective measurable symptoms. If I function perfectly - then my feelings are not real, or at best just an unpleasant background noise that can be tolerated. I am nothing but a mental hypochondriac - there is nothing objectively wrong with me and the only reason I am not happy is because I choose not to be it.</p>
            
            <p>But this "imposter syndrome" was not just a strong subjective feeling - it was also validated by objective medical criteria. In order to receive a diagnosis of a mental illness worthy of treatment I had to score particularly badly on multiple functional scales - what is the quality and duration of my sleep, how is my appetite, how is my concentration levels, etc. If I sleep well enough, eat well enough, enough and generally act as a healthy and balanced person, then I am one. This makes perfect sense from the point of view of the system - well performing active members who generate economic value are healthy by definition. The problem is, I adopted this view also on the individual mental-emotional level. I perform well therefore I am healthy.</p>
            
            <p>It finally took a particularly hard depressive phase to convince me that in spite of me feeling like an imposter, I should seek out professional help. Or at the very least - a diagnosis. I went to a couple of meetings with a therapist and was surprised that she focused as much on subjective measures as on objective functional ones. Sure, she started by ticking through the official form noting down how I sleep and eat (just about good enough to function properly). But most of the time she dedicated to asking me about my feelings, or the lack of them. I could finally say out loud that I struggle to find any joy in life. That I live only for my daughters. This was the first time that I had the feeling that these heavy emotional states do matter. That they should not be accepted or tolerated or ignored. That the fact that I was fully functional - a caring parent of two girls, working a full time job to support my family, engaged in a demanding voluntary role in the board of directors of the kindergarten- was rather a part of the problem rather than a proof of the lack of it. The therapist suggested that I immediately and drastically reduce my workload so that I could free the time and energy to deal with my poor mental health. It was the exact opposite of my instinct. The "functioning" was my medicine, my savior, the only thing that kept me away from the brink. I made sure to sleep enough, eat enough, exercise enough so that I could perform. Her advice was the exact opposite to my strong belief that this functioning is the official evidence that I can't be doing that bad and that the darkness that fills me inside is nothing serious, real or important. Keep calm and carry on.</p>
            
            <p>But deep inside I guess I knew since years that this persistent depressive disorder was not sustainable. And so did the people around me. But I was not quite ready to accept it yet. Everything comes in its time.</p>
