            <h2>My Journey with High-Functioning Depression</h2>
            <p>At the age of 43, after dealing with high-functioning depression for many years I’ve decided to go all in and start a psychoanalysis. Three times a week, lying down on a sofa, deliberately diving into the dark depths I was avoiding for most of my life.</p>
            <p>I would like to share some thoughts and feelings about this “high-functioning depression”. Also nicknamed “smiling depression”, or in its clinical name: Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD). In recent years there has been a lot of open and healthy discussions surrounding mental health. An increasing number of people share stories of their struggle with anxiety, especially following the covid pandemic and recent geo-political developments. Others are brave enough to write about their major depression disorder (MDD) - the debilitating illness that prevented them from leading a well managed and content life, instead rendering them passive spectators of a life on hold. Reading these stories and testimonials, I felt relieved to learn that I was not alone with my mental health struggles. At the same time, I could never fully identify with these accounts of anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, I never stumbled upon this weird sibling condition - the smiling depression. I have a feeling that there’s a reason for that. It has to do with this single adjective - “highly-functional”.</p>
            <p>People sharing their mental health struggles tended to emphasize the unmistakable and explicit manifestations of these conditions in their everyday life, symptoms that prevented them from doing the things that would actually be beneficial for them (socializing, resting, loving, traveling, working out, etc). This was almost always the part where I felt like I lost the thread - like this wasn’t something similar to what I am struggling with after all. They were obviously struggling and in pain, I wasn’t sure I was. They had real symptoms, I had none. They were corageously fighting debilitating illnesses, I was a pathetic wanna-be victim complaining about made-up problems. Reading accounts of anxiety and depression always followed the same pattern- I was first excited to read about feelings I secretly harbored for such a long time only to be later disillusioned to find out that these feelings had to be rooted in what really matters - objective measurable symptoms. If I function perfectly - then my feelings are just an unpleasant background noise that can be tolerated. I am nothing but a mental hypochondriac - there is nothing objectively wrong with me and the only reason I am not happy is because I choose not to be.</p>
            <p>But this “imposter syndrome” was not just a strong subjective feeling - it was also validated by objective medical criteria. In order to receive a diagnosis of a mental illness worthy of treatment I had to score particularly badly on multiple functional scales - what is the quality and duration of my sleep, how is my appetite, how is my concentration levels, etc. If I sleep well enough, eat well enough, concentrate well and generally function as a healthy and balanced person, then I am one.</p>

            <p>It finally took a particularly hard depressive phase to convince me that in spite of me feeling like an imposter, I should seek out professional help. Or at the very least - a diagnosis. I went to a couple of meetings with a therapist and was surprised that she focused as much on subjective measures as on objective functional ones. Sure, she started by going through the official form noting down how I sleep and eat (just about good enough to function properly). But most of the time she was interested to hear about my feelings, or lack of them. That I struggle to find any joy in life. That I live only for my daughters. This was the first time that I had the feeling that these heavy emotional state does matter. That it should be accepted or tolerated or ignored. That the fact that I was fully functional - a caring parent of two girls, working a full time job to support my family, engaged in a demanding voluntary role in the board of directors of the kindergarten- was rather a part of the problem rather than a reassurance. The therapist suggested that I immediately and drastically reduce my workload so that I could free the time and energy to deal with my poor mental health. It was the exact opposite of my instinct. The “functioning” was my medicine, my savior, the only thing that keeps me away from the brink. I made sure to sleep enough, eat enough, exercise enough so that I could function. It was the exact opposite of my belief - that this functioning is the official guarantee that I can’t be doing that bad and that the darkness that fills me inside is nothing serious, real or important. Keep calm and carry on.</p>
            <p>But deep inside I guess I knew since years that this persistent depressive disorder was not sustainable. And so did the people around me.</p>
